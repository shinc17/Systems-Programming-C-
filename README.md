C Language Programming

This is a collection of code that I wrote while practicing C programming language. Below is a brief description of what codes are present and what functions are performed respectively.

Box Calculator

This code gets input from user about how many boxes they want to ship. There are type 1 and 2 boxes, which have different sizes. 
The program calculate the total sizes and shipping cost for it which includes dicount fee for remaining spaces.

This code calculates volume of pool and hot tub by using user's input information. Then, Total water and cost will be calculated. 
After finish calculation, system will ask users whether make anouther calculation or not.

Various Functions

This code generates basic GUI and gets input from users to activate various functions. There are various functions such as:
Factorials / Fibonacci / Towers of Hanoi / Reversing / Conversion to ASCII
After finish using functions, it also calculate how many times user used functions.

Solving Maze

This code generate maze with defined size. Maze contains obstacles that object cannot pass through. 
This code calculates automatically how the object can reach to the goal. After calculation, it prints the way that object needs to go.

Linked List

This code is generally about linked list. There are 10 functions about it:
create empty node list, create non-empty node list, insert object in front of list, insert object in middele of list,
insert object in end of list, delete object in front of list, delete object in middele of list,
delete object in end of list, traverse, and search object in list.
